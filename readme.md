## Build with :
* PHP 8
* Bootstrap for dashboard
* Sass for the public pages
* mySQL
* Vanilla JS

This website was designed for my second job as photographer, which you can take a look [here](https://antoinepetit.com).
It has been designed with four main objectives:

1. Allowing prospective clients to discover my work.
2. Positioning myself well on Google with thoughtful SEO (I am currently on the first page of local search).
3. Providing a comprehensive dashboard enabling client management with scheduling and tracking of actions taken.
4. Allowing the hosting of online galleries for my clients, managing their private access and the distribution of their images.
